<p>In this project, we set out to uncover answers to a question that we 
have pondered for some time: if popular music in any given country is 
more upbeat, faster tempo, and generally more energetic and danceable, 
will the people who live be happier? To uncover these answers, we worked
 with data harvested from Spotify, the World Population Review, and the 
World Happiness Report to determine whether countries that report higher
 happiness levels also listen to more upbeat music. By filtering large 
metadata sets of music to find matches with songs that placed in the top
 spotify charts for various countries internationally,, we hoped to find
 trends among popular songs in each nation. By looking at a song’s 
tempo, danceability, valence, loudness and energy, we were able to match
 datasets about the top songs in several countries to the World 
Happiness Report to determine if there is a correlation between the 
upbeatness of popular music in a given nation and that nation’s 
happiness.</p>
<p>We initially hoped to use Spotify’s API to harvest up-to-date 
metadata about currently popular songs in various locales, Spotify 
unfortunately removed this feature from their API last fall. However, 
ample archived datasets of thousands of songs exist on Kaggle, and we 
were fortunate to find datasets listing the top 100 songs in every 
nation where Spotify is currently available in the years 2023 and 2025. 
By matching these datasets to the World Happiness Report, we hoped to 
uncover answers to the following questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Do happier countries listen to more upbeat, danceable music?</p></li>
<li><p>If so, will these trends appear regardless of socioeconomic factors like GDP per capita, or will we<br>
need to control for wealth and human development?</p></li>
<li><p>Have these trends changed since 2023, when the analytic data was collected?<br>
Or do the happier countries’ trend remain the same?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The World Happiness Report, published annually by the University of Oxford’s Wellbeing<br>
Research Centre in partnership with Gallup, attempts to understand and analyze how people<br>
experience and process happiness by using a questioning method called Cantril Ladder. The<br>
participants are asked the following question to rate their “happiness”:
 “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 
10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life 
for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life 
for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel 
you stand at this time?” (Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of
 Oxford &amp; Gallup, 2025).</p>
<p><br>
This question is carefully worded so that it can be universally translated and understood. On<br>
average, more than 100,000 people from 140 different countries participate in the survey, and<br>
data is collected throughout the year to accommodate differences in local factors.<br>
For this project, the following columns were extracted from the dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Country name: Official name of the represented country</p></li>
<li><p>Ladder score, which represents the “happiness score” we are mainly interested in.</p></li>
<li><p>The Log GDP per capita measures the average economic well-being per person using a<br>
logarithmic scale</p></li>
<li><p>Social support indicated whether participants have someone they can rely on during<br>
difficult situations. The answers were logged using a binary system where 0 is no and 1<br>
is yes.</p></li>
<li><p>Generosity reflects whether participants have donated any money to charity in the past<br>
month. Once again, the answers were logged using a binary system where 0 is no and 1<br>
is yes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To process this data set, we renamed columns for more intuitive 
understanding, e.g., “Healthy.life.expectancy” became “life_exp.” 
Moreover, we discarded columns with less relevant or repetitive data, 
e.g., columns that repeated data in columns like “Social.support” with 
“Explainedby.Social.Support.”</p>

This dataset, compiled by KEVINAM, was extracted from Spotify’s Top 50 Global Chart<br>
(10/18/23 to 11/18/23) using the Spotify Web API. This dataset contains not only information<br>
about top songs in over a hundred nations, but also compiles key music 
analytics such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and the country
 where it charted.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Danceability “describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of<br>
musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and 
overall regularity” (Spotify, 2025). Its values range from 0.0 to 1.0, 
where higher value is considered more ‘danceable.’</p></li>
<li><p>Energy represents the “perceptual measure of intensity” and activity of the song and is<br>
also measured from 0 to 1.0 scale (Spotify, 2025).</p></li>
<li><p>The Loudness is the average decibel of the track, typically ranging from -60 dB to 0 dB.</p></li>
<li><p>Valence measures the musical positiveness of a track, with higher
 scores indicating happier and more cheerful songs, and lower scores 
suggesting sad, angry, or depressed moods.</p></li>
<li><p>Tempo is the song’s speed represented by beats per minute (BPM).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To process this dataset, we discarded columns feautring metadata that
 did not describe qualities related to a tracks upbeatness, e.g., 
“liveness,” which referred to whether a song was recorded live, “key,” 
which might have some indication of a song’s mood, but which neither of 
us had the music theory background to interpret accurately at this time,
 and “vocalness,” which described whether or not a song had vocals, to 
name three examples.</p>

only the Country and Abbreviation columns were extracted, as this was used to link the Spotify Global charts to the WHR data.</p>

To compare national happiness with current music trends, we used 
compiled music charts on kworb.net for selected countries. This website 
updates its chart on a daily and weekly basis; for this project, chart 
data from 10/16/2025 was used. Only the ‘Artist and Title’ columns was 
extracted. Artist and title were one column split by the ‘-’ delimiter; 
this delimiter was also used to indicate whether a track was remastered,
 e.g., “The Eagles - Hotel California - 2023 Remaster.” Dealing with 
these delimiters proved to be a challenge, which we will revisit later 
in our report.</p>

<p>Our analysis found a weak correlation between pop music’s general 
upbeatness and a country’s self-reported happiness, but it was not the 
correlation we were expecting. Analysis of the top and bottom ten 
countries, as well as of the whole dataset, revealed less happy 
countries were more likely to prefer slightly more upbeat music. It 
could be that people living in more difficult circumstances turn to 
music as a salve, while happier nations, which are also generally more 
well-off, are more willing to engage with downbeat, lower tempo music.</p>

<p>Due to the weak correlation, we hope to revisit these findings when 
the 2025 World Happiness Report is released to see if any trends hold. 
Although 2025 is not over; and the World Happiness Report is still being
 compiled, we were able to gather data about popular music dating from 
January through June of this year. New Zealand and the United States 
both see changes in certain categories, with U.S. hits of 2025 being 
notably less danceable, less valence, higher tempo, and louder than 2023
 hits. This could be reflective of trends in popular music, with hip hop
 being less prevalent on the charts than in the past. New Zealand’s 
shifts are less dramatic, with no changes of more than 5 units in the 
second place value on the chart.</p>
<p>However, the popular music of South Korea is significantly more 
valent, energetic, and higher tempo than it was in 2023. If there is 
indeed a weak correlation between these qualities and a lower happiness 
score, it is possible we see a slight decrease in South Korea’s overall 
happiness once the 2025 World Happiness Report is released. We are 
looking forward to the release of these statistics to see if the trends 
we uncovered hold.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting challenges we faced was ensuring that R 
Tidyverse, Python Pandas, SQL, and Excel Power Query all produced the 
exact same results. Since we started working on the R Tidyverse code 
first, we used those results as our baseline. However, when we tried to 
replicate the process in Python and SQL, each produced different results
 and we were stumped as to why the number of rows did not match, despite
 seemingly using identical datasets and logic.</p>
<p>After some trial and error, we discovered that the problem were 
caused by the way some titles were written. For the Kworb’s Weekly 
Spotify Charts, as it can be seen from the dataset screenshot above, we 
needed to split the Artist and Title column into its own respective 
columns. To do this, we defined hyphen as delimiter and selected the 
first indexed substring as artists and the second indexed substring as 
title. This method worked perfectly for majority of songs. However, 
songs like “Hotel California – 2013 remaster” contained additional 
hyphens and only a part of the title were kept (e.g.&nbsp;“Hotel 
California”). This caused a join error since the 2025 Spotify dataset 
retained the full title.</p>
<p>To overcome this challenge, we needed to find a way to group every 
substring after the first delimiter into one. This was a relatively easy
 fix for the Tidyverse and Pandas as we only needed to include one 
additional parameter inside the string splitting function (see figures 
below). However, this was exceptionally difficult with SQL. After 
thorough research, we found a solution with SUBSTR() and STRPOS() 
functions. Rather than using the STRING_SPLIT() function, we needed to 
use the SUBSTR() to first extract sub-strings within the ‘Artist and 
Title’ column. Then we needed to use STRPOS() function to specify that 
every substring after the first delimiter needed to be group as one. The
 following is the final code for this task in duckDB SQL is shown below:</p>
<pre class="{sql}"><code>#| connection: con

CREATE TABLE new_zealand_25_1 AS
  SELECT TRIM(SUBSTR("Artist and Title", 1, STRPOS("Artist and Title", '-') - 1)) AS artist,
         TRIM(SUBSTR("Artist and Title", STRPOS("Artist and Title", '-') + 1)) AS title
  FROM new_zealand_10_16_25</code></pre>
<p>Once those changes were made, we were able to obtain identical rows 
across all languages and were able to proceed to correlation analysis.</p>

<p>To learn the graphing plots, we primarily relied on online sources 
including Geeks for Geeks and Stack Overflow, as well as looking into R 
documentation for the Corrplot function in particular. Jennifer 
introduced Alejandro to Geeks for Geeks. While Alejandro initially 
attempted to use Gen AI, he found it occasionally erred in describing 
DuckDB’s capabilities versus other flavors of SQL, and ultimately found 
that sites like Stack Overflow, the official DuckDB and Pandas 
documentation, and human-made Power Query how-to sites were more 
reliable than the occasionally wonky at best and wildly inaccurate at 
worst ChatGPT. However, ChatGPT did occasionally prove helpful in 
explaining error codes.</p>
<p>In general, although the R and DuckDB documentation was at times 
difficult to work through and make sense of, we found that these were 
generally the best initially resource for learning about new functions 
and packages, particular those we used to calculate correlations and 
create visualizations. There was some learning curve in initially 
figuring out how best to navigate the sites and find the information we 
were looking for, but these did prove to be the best place to begin. 
From there, we would search for issues with the particular operations we
 were using - e.g., “STRING_SPLIT() multiple delimiters” on Stack 
Overflow.</p>
